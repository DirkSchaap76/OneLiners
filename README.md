Felix added PDF called "Samenvatting Laatste Momenten" to our Googl Drive.
It's a very useful and concise summary of all the topics we need to know for the OCA exam.
But: it's in Dutch. 
We're going to translate this together on tuesday and wednesday @De Plek in Leiden.

I thought it might be useful to add my excercise files so people can follow along and comment if they like.
